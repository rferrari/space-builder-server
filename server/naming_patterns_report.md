# Naming Patterns Report

## Overview
This report reviews the variables and constants defined in `server/config.ts` and their usage across `server/server.ts`, `server/bot.controller.ts`, and `server/workers.ts`. The goal is to enhance naming patterns for better code readability and understanding.

## Variables and Constants in `server/config.ts`

1. **ENV**: 
   - Current Name: `ENV`
   - Suggested Name: `ENVIRONMENT`
   - Reason: More descriptive, indicating it represents the environment configuration.

2. **BotName**: 
   - Current Name: `BotName`
   - Suggested Name: `BOT_NAME`
   - Reason: Use uppercase with underscores for constants to follow common naming conventions.

3. **BotIcon**: 
   - Current Name: `BotIcon`
   - Suggested Name: `BOT_ICON`
   - Reason: Consistency with other constant naming conventions.

4. **TIMEZONE**: 
   - Current Name: `TIMEZONE`
   - Suggested Name: `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`
   - Reason: Clarifies that this is the default timezone setting.

5. **LAST_CONVERSATION_LIMIT**: 
   - Current Name: `LAST_CONVERSATION_LIMIT`
   - Suggested Name: `MAX_LAST_CONVERSATION_LIMIT`
   - Reason: Indicates it is a maximum limit, improving clarity.

6. **LOG_MESSAGES**: 
   - Current Name: `LOG_MESSAGES`
   - Suggested Name: `ENABLE_LOGGING`
   - Reason: More descriptive of its purpose.

7. **USE_WS**: 
   - Current Name: `USE_WS`
   - Suggested Name: `ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS`
   - Reason: More descriptive, indicating the purpose of the variable.

8. **WS_PORT**: 
   - Current Name: `WS_PORT`
   - Suggested Name: `WEBSOCKET_PORT`
   - Reason: More descriptive, indicating it is specifically for WebSocket connections.

9. **maxMessageHistorySize**: 
   - Current Name: `maxMessageHistorySize`
   - Suggested Name: `MAX_MESSAGE_HISTORY_SIZE`
   - Reason: Consistency with constant naming conventions.

10. **memoryExpirationDuration**: 
    - Current Name: `memoryExpirationDuration`
    - Suggested Name: `MEMORY_EXPIRATION_DURATION`
    - Reason: Consistency with constant naming conventions.

11. **MEMORY_CLEANUP_MIN**: 
    - Current Name: `MEMORY_CLEANUP_MIN`
    - Suggested Name: `MEMORY_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
    - Reason: More descriptive of its purpose.

12. **CHAT_BOT_MODEL**: 
    - Current Name: `CHAT_BOT_MODEL`
    - Suggested Name: `DEFAULT_CHAT_BOT_MODEL`
    - Reason: Indicates it is the default model used for the chat bot.

13. **WORKERS_MODEL**: 
    - Current Name: `WORKERS_MODEL`
    - Suggested Name: `DEFAULT_WORKERS_MODEL`
    - Reason: Indicates it is the default model used for workers.

14. **VENICE_JSON_MODEL**: 
    - Current Name: `VENICE_JSON_MODEL`
    - Suggested Name: `DEFAULT_VENICE_JSON_MODEL`
    - Reason: Indicates it is the default model for Venice JSON.

15. **OPENAI_API_KEY**: 
    - Current Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    - Suggested Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    - Reason: No change needed; it is already clear and follows conventions.

16. **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: 
    - Current Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    - Suggested Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    - Reason: No change needed; it is already clear and follows conventions.

17. **VENICE_API_KEY**: 
    - Current Name: `VENICE_API_KEY`
    - Suggested Name: `VENICE_API_KEY`
    - Reason: No change needed; it is already clear and follows conventions.

## Usage in Other Files

- In `server/server.ts`, the constants are used to configure the WebSocket server and log messages. The suggested naming conventions will improve clarity when reading the code.
- In `server/bot.controller.ts`, the constants are used to initialize the chat bot and manage memory. The suggested names will help developers understand the purpose of each variable at a glance.
- In `server/workers.ts`, the constants are used to manage worker models and API keys. The suggested naming conventions will enhance readability and maintainability.

## Conclusion
Implementing these naming pattern enhancements will lead to improved code readability and understanding across the project. Consistent naming conventions help developers quickly grasp the purpose of variables and constants, ultimately leading to better collaboration and maintenance.
